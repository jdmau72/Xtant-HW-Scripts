# Xtant Medical HW Scripts
A collection of ExcelScripts used to streamline many functions of the Hardware team. Scripts available as both .osts and .ts files - the former used in Excel, the latter for ease of reading and editing. .ts files can quickly be "compiled" to .osts files and vice versa with the provided bash scripts. 

## HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN
(!) If you have not used any ExcelScripts before do the following first:
1. On any open Excel file, navigate to the "Automate" pane at the top
2. Click "New Script". A panel will open on the right side of the screen. 
3. Click the "+ New Script". This will create the necessary folder to add and use these scripts. 
4. Click the back arrow to go back to ${\textsf{\color{green}"<- All Scripts"}}$
5. At the bottom of the tab, click ${\textsf{\color{green}"View more scripts ->"}}$


## HW Return AutoFormatting Script
Sets up the necessary columns and generates conditional formatting for ${\textsf{\color{red}FAIL}}$, ${\textsf{\color{grey}MIA}}$, and ${\textsf{\color{green}EXTRA}}$ statuses, as well as formatting for ${\textsf{\color{yellow}Lot Adjustments}}$.
